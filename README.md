# SWTP
## This repository features most of the process of combining data into a dataset, imputing the missing values, and building a LSTM-based RNN to forecast the influent flow.
## If you wish to follow along chronologically, the folders were created in the order: data, correlation, imputation, and forecasting.
## Data is the process of sourcing data and combining it all
## Correlation doesn't really have much of value beyond the rainfall heatmap in "Rainfall Distance Correlation.png"
## Imputation has an .ipynb file that has the entire imputation process and some data visualization functions
## Forecasting has a few .ipynb files that create stacked LSTM models for forecasting. The one used at the end was lstm4.ipynb.
